# Facial Recognition Using Deep Neural Network

This repository includes jupyter notebooks and test pictures of our project.

We are trying to predict the names of people in a picture provided.

To do this, we considered a well-known pre-trained Convolutional Deep Neural Networks, called VGG-FACE.

Then we created our own datasets and fine tuned the model, trained the customized model again.

## Facial Recognition Using Pre-Trained VGG-Face + OpenCV
#### Jupyter notebook of our project can be found here [Pre_Trained_Vgg_Face.ipynb](https://github.com/skylarhuang/ML_project/blob/master/pre_trained_vgg_face.ipynb)

In VGG-Face, the dataset has already be trained and weights can be downloaded from [here](http:http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/vgg_face/src/vgg_face_matconvnet.tar.gz).

We are building our project according to [this](https://aboveintelligent.com/face-recognition-with-keras-and-opencv-2baf2a83b799) page.
We are using the OpenCV cascade to cut out faces referencing [this](https://realpython.com/blog/python/face-recognition-with-python/)  page.

Result:

## Train VGG-Face Architecture Using Our Own Dataset
#### Jupyter notebook of our project can be found here [Fine_Tuning_Vgg_Face.ipynb](https://github.com/skylarhuang/ML_project/blob/master/Fine_Tuning_Vgg_Face.ipynb).

We created our own dataset with 1496 photos of 10 different celebrities. 
The size of our databset is over 100 files so you can download it from here (*link deleted*).

#### UPDATE
#### Please do not ask for access to this dataset. This is a private dataset created by our own with huge efforts. Niether do I have the right to share nor will I share. Thanks.

We were trying to fine tune layer to VGG-Face achitecture refrencing [this](https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html) page and [this](https://github.com/rcmalli/keras-vggface) page.

We also imported some twists to our dataset, and compared the results to the origin one.
